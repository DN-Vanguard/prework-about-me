      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a UW Foster School of Business graduate pursuing a career change from sales/marketing.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am born and raised in Seattle, WA!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to play with my two dogs (Louis and Bear) and go play tennis when I have time!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>After graduating with a Marketing and IS degree, I realized that it is rare for a job that would utilize both degrees, and so I only worked full time using my marketing knowledge
        and not my IS, but now... I realized that I have a passion for coding, and want to be a software engineer or product manager. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still residing in Washington. The only difference is that I moved cities from Seattle to Renton.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Having been exposed to coding in college, I didn't pursue it as much as I should have.
        After receiving a BA and landing a full time role, I thought my life would be set, but after being in a role where I don't enjoy for 7 months,
        I realized that going back to school was the best option for me in obtaining my dream job.
